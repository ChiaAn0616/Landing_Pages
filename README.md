Landing Pages Showcase

This repository contains all the landing pages I create for clients and personal projects.
Only the live demo links are publicly accessible — the source code is kept private to protect client work and project assets.

I use this repo as a central place for clients to preview completed landing pages, review design quality, and access project demo links.

🔗 Live Demo Links

All landing pages can be viewed through the public URLs provided under each project folder.
(For example: S3/CloudFront hosted links, Netlify, or GitHub Pages — depending on deployment.)

📌 Notes

Source code remains private for security and client confidentiality.

Only final deployed versions are publicly available for preview.

New landing pages will be added over time.
